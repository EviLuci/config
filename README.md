### Cloning the Repository

Before running the installation scripts, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EviLuci/dotfiles.git
```

It is recommended to review the script and understand its actions before executing it.

### Arch Base Installation

The `arch_base_install.sh` script is used to configure and set up everything during Arch Linux installation. It includes system configurations, package installations, bootloader setup, user creation, and initial dotfiles setup.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Please use the `arch_base_install.sh` script at your own risk. This script is experimental at the moment and makes system-level changes and is only advisable to be used during fresh arch installation after going through arch installation wiki and entering arch-chroot environment.

To run the Arch base installation script:

```bash
cd dotfiles
chmod +x arch_base_install.sh
cd
./dotfiles/arch_base_install.sh
```

### Hypr Install

The `hypr_install.sh` script installs packages that i use in my personal setup and sets up dotfiles. This script is useful for installing additional packages and configuring dotfiles after a fresh base Arch Linux installation.

To run the Hypr installation script, `cd` into the cloned `dotfiles` directory and then run:

```bash
./hypr_install.sh
```

### Dotfiles Setup

The `dotfiles_setup.sh` script is used solely for setting up dotfiles. It can be used independently of the Arch Linux installation scripts to quickly set up dotfiles on existing systems.

To run the dotfiles setup script, `cd` into the cloned `dotfiles` directory and then run:

```bash
./dotfiles_setup.sh
```

## Usage

These installation scripts are designed to be used on Arch Linux systems. Before running the scripts, make sure to review and customize the configurations according to your preferences. Additionally, ensure that you have backed up any existing configurations that may be overwritten during the installation process.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the dotfiles and installation scripts to better suit your needs. You can modify the configurations, add or remove packages, or extend the scripts to automate additional tasks.
